# Cats vs Dogs Classifier
 Cats vs Dogs Classifier is a deep learning-based image classification project that identifies whether an image contains a cat, a dog, or neither. It uses a pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction and fine-tuning, with a Flask-based API for real-time classification. The model processes uploaded images and returns predictions along with confidence scores.
