# Cats vs Dogs Classifier
 Cats vs Dogs Classifier is a deep learning-based image classification project that identifies whether an image contains a cat, a dog, or neither. It uses a pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction and fine-tuning, with a Flask-based API for real-time classification. The model processes uploaded images and returns predictions along with confidence scores.

## Features
- **Model Training**: Uses Transfer Learning (VGG16) with fine-tuning
- **Web Interface**: Flask-based API for classification
- **Preprocessing**: Image augmentation and validation split
- **Deployment Ready**: REST API for image classification
